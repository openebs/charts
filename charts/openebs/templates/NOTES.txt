Successfully installed OpenEBS.

Check the status by running: kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

The default values enables OpenEBS hostpath, device and jiva engines along with 
their default storage classes. Use `kubectl get sc` to see the list of installed 
OpenEBS StorageClasses. 

For other engines, you will need to perform a few more additional steps to
enable the engine, configure the engines (like creating pools) and create 
storage classes. 

For example, cStor can be enabled using commands like:

helm upgrade {{ .Release.Name }} openebs/openebs  --set cstor.enabled=true --reuse-values --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}
